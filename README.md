****Breast Cancer Analysis****

**Overview:**

This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data using Python. The analysis leverages libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization. The goal is to gain insights into the dataset and understand the distribution and relationships of various features associated with breast cancer.

**Dataset:**

This dataset of breast cancer patients was obtained from the 2017 November update of the SEER Program of the NCI, which provides information on population-based cancer statistics. The dataset involved female patients with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer (SEER primary cites recode NOS histology codes 8522/3) diagnosed in 2006-2010. Patients with unknown tumour size, examined regional LNs, positive regional LNs, and patients whose survival months were less than 1 month were excluded; thus, 4024 patients were ultimately included.


**Run the notebook:**

Open the Breast Cancer.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

**Follow the analysis:**

The notebook guides you through the steps of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

**Data Visualization:**

The project includes various visualizations to better understand the data, such as:
  Histograms and distribution plots of features
  Correlation heatmaps
  Pair plots to visualize relationships between features
  Boxplots to identify outliers

**Results:**

The final section of the notebook presents insights derived from the data analysis. Visualizations and summary statistics help in understanding the distribution of features and their relationships with breast cancer diagnosis.
